            <p>
            The bell tolls, and the lords rise, to take
            their throne. But what if they refuse to
            link the flame? The Unkindled will rise,
            and some may face the challenge. For Ash
            seeketh embers.

            You are unkindled, a being that tried,
            but failed to link the fire. You must
            try again. The Age of Fire is fading,
            and soon, only dark will remain. After
            gathering the lords as kindling, you must visit
            the Kiln of the First Flame.

            Can you defeat the Soul of Cinder? The
            embodiment of mightier souls whom had
            succeeded in linking the flame. And if you
            succeed, will you retain the cycle? Will
            you link the flame? Or forsake it? Or perhaps,
            something else? The Hollows of Londor seek a new
            Lord. And the guiding Firekeeper of Firelink Shrine
            is ever so gentle and helpful. You must decide your fate.
