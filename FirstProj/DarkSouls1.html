            <p>
            Shipped away to the Undead Asylum, the player character
            starts out as one doomed to await the end of the world. Through
            the actions of one who believed in a prophecy to guide the world
            back into light by rekindling the old flame, you find yourself freed.

            Thus, the Chosen Undead maketh pilgrimage to the land of Lords, Lordran.
            They rest at Firelink Shrine, and continue the steps to fulfill the prophecy,
            by gathering the souls of the Great Lords to gain access to the Kiln of the
            First Flame. There, they will take on Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight, who long ago
            sacrificed himself to rekindle the flame, much like your quest.

            But you need not follow in the footsteps of one who seeks to stifle the
            ushering of a new age. A choice is upon you. Kindle the flame, and grant
            the world an extended period of the Age of Fire? Or allow it to fade,
            and usher in an Age of Darkness.

            In truth, it matters little. The cycle always starts again. Thou who art Undead,
            art Chosen.
