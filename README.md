Decantation is a game I created using the pygame library within python. All code is visible within the "DecantationOptimized" folder, but will not run due to the exclusion of the sound and visual assets. However, I have included an exe bundled in the "Decantation" folder.

Most of my complex school programs will reside within my CSC205 folder, all written in Java, and the later programs implementing OOP. All code is genuinely mine, other than the "GreekHeroArray" in Program 4 in the CSC205 folder.
