# Coding-Projects

Decantation is a game I created using the pygame library within python. All code is visible within the "DecantationOptimized" folder, but will not run due to the exclusion of the sound and visual assets. However, I have included an exe bundled in the "Decantation" folder.

Most of my complex school programs will reside within my CSC205 folder, all written in Java, and the later programs implementing OOP. There are additional school programs in a separate repo.

All CSC100 and CSC240 code are written in C++, while all CSC205 code is written in Java.

FirstProj is a simple webpage I created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap.

This repo will also include educational projects from personal learning and training, mostly from Udemy.
